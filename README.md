# CPSC-33511-Project2
2024 California State University Fullerton CPSC 335-11 (Algorithm Engineering) Project 2

Opponent Avoidance Problem
Polynomial versus Exponential Time

### Hypothesis
This project will test the following hypotheses:
1. Exhaustive search algorithms can be implemented, and produce correct outputs.
2. Algorithms with exponential or factorial running times are extremely slow, probably too
slow to be of practical use.
To test these hypotheses, you will implement two algorithms:
1. a 𝑂(𝑛. 2
𝑛
) - time exhaustive search algorithm for the staged opponent avoidance
problem; and
2. a O(𝑛
2
) − time dynamic programming algorithm for the same problem.
