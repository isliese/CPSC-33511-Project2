# CPSC-33511 Project 2
2024 California State University Fullerton CPSC 335-11 (Algorithm Engineering) Project 2 <p> <p>

Opponent Avoidance Problem <br>
Polynomial versus Exponential Time

<br>

## Instructions for running each algorithm
 

<br><br><br>

## Hypothesis 
This project will test the following hypotheses:
1. Exhaustive search algorithms can be implemented, and produce correct outputs.
2. Algorithms with exponential or factorial running times are extremely slow, probably too
slow to be of practical use. <br> <br>

To test these hypotheses, you will implement two algorithms:
* a 𝑂(𝑛. $$2^𝑛$$) - time exhaustive search algorithm for the staged opponent avoidance
problem
* a O($$𝑛^2$$) − time dynamic programming algorithm for the same problem.

<br>

## Problem 
The Opponent Avoidance Problem
The staged opponent avoidance problem is a puzzle that comes from a modified real-life scenario,
where soccer players of a team maneuver through an opponent-filled field in order to find a safe
passage to reach the goal post.
