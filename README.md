# CPSC-33511 Project 2
2024 California State University Fullerton CPSC 335-11 (Algorithm Engineering) Project 2 <p> <p> <br>

## Project Subject
Opponent Avoidance Problem <br>
Polynomial versus Exponential Time

<br>

## Requirements for dependencies 
Required modules: `matplotlib` `numpy` `time` `random`

<br>

## Instructions for running each algorithm
1. Clone Repository: `https://github.com/isliese/CPSC-33511-Project2.git` <br>
2. `cd CPSC-33511-Project2` <br>
3. Run programs
To run Exhaustive Search Algorithm: `python exhaustivesearch.py` <br>
To run Dynamic Programming: `python dynamicprogramming.py` <br>
To measure execution time of two algorithms for the problem: `python timingdata.py` <br>
To draw scatter plots for two algorithms and compare with theoretical time complexity: `python scatterplot.py` <br>



<br><br><br>

## Hypothesis 
This project will test the following hypotheses:
1. Exhaustive search algorithms can be implemented, and produce correct outputs.
2. Algorithms with exponential or factorial running times are extremely slow, probably too
slow to be of practical use. <br> <br>

To test these hypotheses, you will implement two algorithms:
* a ùëÇ(ùëõ. $$2^ùëõ$$) - time exhaustive search algorithm for the staged opponent avoidance
problem
* a O($$ùëõ^2$$) ‚àí time dynamic programming algorithm for the same problem.

<br>

## Problem 
The Opponent Avoidance Problem
The staged opponent avoidance problem is a puzzle that comes from a modified real-life scenario,
where soccer players of a team maneuver through an opponent-filled field in order to find a safe
passage to reach the goal post.
