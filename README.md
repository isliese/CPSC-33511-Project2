# 2024 California State University Fullerton CPSC 335-11 (Algorithm Engineering) Project 2

Opponent Avoidance Problem
Polynomial versus Exponential Time

<br>

### Hypothesis
This project will test the following hypotheses:
1. Exhaustive search algorithms can be implemented, and produce correct outputs.
2. Algorithms with exponential or factorial running times are extremely slow, probably too
slow to be of practical use. <br> <br>
To test these hypotheses, you will implement two algorithms:
*  a 𝑂(𝑛. $$2^𝑛$$) - time exhaustive search algorithm for the staged opponent avoidance
problem
*  a O($$𝑛^2$$) − time dynamic programming algorithm for the same problem.
